# Raspberry Pi Ultrasonic Obstacle Detection

This repository contains the code for an ultrasonic obstacle detection system built with a Raspberry Pi. The system uses an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to detect objects within 5 cm and activates an LED as a visual indicator.

## Components Required
- Raspberry Pi (Any model that supports GPIO)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- LED
- 220-ohm resistor
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- 
## install
sudo apt install python3-rpi.gpio
